My name is Ethan, my twitter is <a href='https://twitter.com/similartoethab'>@similartoethab</a>, and I am a coder. I am proficient with html, css, and js. Currently, I am working with C# on a Unity Project (4/21/21). It is <a href="similar-to-ethab.github.io/notAnything.html">this game</a> I created on my website, but made in Unity and with C#. I am working on creating a rules page (4/21/21) so the objective is more clear.

I am open to collaboration, because I would like to learn more about stuff. If you have any recommendations or want to contact me, pm me at my twitter <a href='https://twitter.com/similartoethab'>@similartoethab</a>
